Welcome to **Harmonie's Lab**!  
This project is a collection of open source mechanics and systems for [S&Box](https://sbox.game), designed to help developers learn, experiment, and build their own games.

## Features

- Modular, easy-to-understand code
- Example areas for each mechanic (that may become scenes as the project grows)
- Bite size code comments and blog posts
- Open source and free to use in your own projects (A mention would be nice but not nessesary)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/harmonies-lab.git
    ```
2. **Add the .sbproj to your S&Box editor.**
3. **Explore the mechanics, prefabs and understandable map.**
